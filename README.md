BookstoreInventoryGUI
An interactive graphical user interface (GUI) is created using Python's TKinter library to examine a retail bookstore's inventory, by accessing its SQL database. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is used extensively. In order to keep the GUI separate from the underlying database a data access object (DAO) is created which serves as an intermediary.
A sample screenshot of the GUI is presented as "bookstore_inventory_gui_screenshot.png".
